 abstract = {We analyse one of the classical proofs of the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem. Cardinal numbers are associated with crucial steps of the proof. These are intended to measure, in some sense, the mathematical power of the statement proved in that step. By comparing the cardinal numbers we gather some information on which implications in are not provably reversible.},
